How to run the encode_mesh and decode_mesh programs:

1. Please modified inside the Makefile for the directory into which the SPL is installed , i.e., 
change the directory path of the SPL_TOPDIR

2. Use the Make utility to generate the execution file: (Command: make all)

==========================
Run encode_mesh program, and save the compressed EB file to $eb_file:
./encode_mesh < $mesh_dir/bunny_hole.off > $eb_file

==========================
Run decode_mesh program, and save the decompressed OFF file to $off_file:
./decode_mesh < $mesh_dir/bunny_hole.eb > $off_file

==========================
Run encode_mesh and decode_mesh programs together, and save the decompressed OFF file to $off_file:
./encode_mesh < $mesh_dir/bunny_hole.off | ./decode_mesh > $off_file

==========================
To prints help information:
./encode_mesh -h
./decode_mesh -h

==========================
To collects the results information:
./encode_mesh < $mesh_dir/bunny_hole.off -r $results_file
./decode_mesh < $mesh_dir/bunny_hole.eb -r $results_file


How to run the mesh_clean program:
1. Use the Make utility to generate the execution file: (Command: make mesh_clean)

==========================
Remove duplicated vertices only, and save the output OFF file to $off_file:
./mesh_clean < $mesh_dir/crank.off > $off_file

==========================
Remove duplicated vertices and scaling, and save the output OFF file to $off_file:
./mesh_clean -s $scaling_factor < $mesh_dir/crank.off > $off_file
(E.g.: ./mesh_clean -s 100 < $mesh_dir/crank.off > $off_file)

WARNING:
The mesh_clean program doesn't contain the option to ONLY scaling the vertices without check and remove the duplicated vertices.  
This is due to the fact that the primary goal for this software is to check and remove the duplicated vertices.
